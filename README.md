# Migo Marketplace

Migo Marketplace is a full-featured online platform where buyers and sellers come together to list, discover, and manage items, services, and job postings. Whether you’re listing a household item, offering a specialized service, or recruiting for a new position, Migo provides an intuitive interface to manage your listings and keep track of interactions.

- **Like Yelp + Google Maps + Marketplace:** Discover and review local businesses, explore map-based service listings, and manage direct transactions.
- **Yellow Pages 2.0:** An AI-powered directory where you can search, filter, and connect with vendors, services, items, and job postings in your area.

## What You Can Do

- **Search Nearby Services:** Interactive map and location filters help you find vendors for any need—restaurants, cleaners, event planners, and more.
- **AskMigo AI Assistant:** Chat with our AI guide to get personalized recommendations (e.g., “Plan my party,” “Find a plumber now”) and curated vendor lists.
- **Direct Vendor Contact:** Send messages, negotiate prices, and book services directly through our chat interface.
- **Manage Listings:** Create, edit, and track your own service or item listings, set availability, upload images, and monitor responses in your dashboard.
- **Reviews & Ratings:** Read community reviews, leave feedback, and build trust with star ratings and detailed comments.
